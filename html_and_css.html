        <!--An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages.
With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire web site, by changing one file!
To use an external style sheet, add a link to it in the <head> section of the HTML page:-->
        <link rel = "stylesheet" href = "mystyles.css">

    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Welcome to this page!</h1>
        
        <!--
        A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available 
        (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
        The <div> element is a block-level element.
        Block level elements in HTML:
        <address><article><aside><blockquote><canvas><dd><div><dl><dt><fieldset><figcaption><figure>
        <footer><form><h1>-<h6><header><hr><li><main><nav><noscript><ol><output><p><pre><section><table>
        <tfoot><ul><video>

        The <div> element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.
        The <div> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.
        When used together with CSS, the <div> element can be used to style blocks of content:
        -->

        <div class = "avatar">
         <!--inserted link as image -->
        <a href="https://github.com/ayguno">
            <img id = "profile" src = "ozan.jpg" alt = "My GitHub page">
        </a>
        </div>

        <!--
        Inline Elements
        An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.
        Inline elements in HTML:
        <a><abbr><acronym><b><bdo><big><br><button><code><dfn><em><i><input><kbd><label><map>
        <object><q><samp><script><select><small><span><strong><sub><sup><textarea><time><tt><var>
        
        The <span> Element
        The <span> element is often used as a container for some text.
        The <span> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.
        When used together with CSS, the <span> element can be used to style parts of the text:
        -->

        <a href = "#B1">Move to <span id="important">bookmarked</span> section below.</a>

        <!--inserted link as text with CSS properties in linked style sheet -->
        <!--
            The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.
            The target attribute can have one of the following values:
            _blank - Opens the linked document in a new window or tab
            _self - Opens the linked document in the same window/tab as it was clicked (this is default)
            _parent - Opens the linked document in the parent frame
            _top - Opens the linked document in the full body of the window
            framename - Opens the linked document in a named frame

         <!--To define a specific style for one special element, 
            add an id attribute to the element:
            Tip: The id attribute can be used on any HTML element.
            Note: The id value is case-sensitive.
            Note: The id value must contain at least one character, 
            and must not contain whitespace (spaces, tabs, etc.)
            The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element 
            (the value must be unique within the HTML document).
            The id value can be used by CSS and JavaScript to perform 
            certain tasks for a unique element with the specified id value.
            In CSS, to select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) 
            character, followed by the id of the element:.-->

            have the same format and style.

        An iframe is used to display a web page within a web page.
        An HTML iframe is defined with the <iframe> tag:
        The src attribute specifies the URL (web address) of the inline frame page. 
        Use the height and width attributes to specify the size of the iframe.
T       attribute values are specified in pixels by default, but they can also be in 
        percent (like "80%").
        
        By default, an iframe has a border around it. 
        To remove the border, add the style attribute and use the CSS border property.

            JavaScript can access elements with a specified class name by using 
            the getElementsByClassName() method:

            Example:
            When a user clicks on a button, hide all elements 
            with the class name "avatar":
        -->
        <script>

        Using The id Attribute in JavaScript:
        JavaScript can access an element with a 
        specified id by using the getElementById() method.
        Example:
        Use the id attribute to manipulate text with JavaScript:-->
        <script>
        function displayResult(){
            document.getElementById('p01').innerHTML = "Learning is an amazing journey!"
